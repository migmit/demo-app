Fuck

Demo App

you will need to install:
- play 2.2.X http://www.playframework.com/download (classic distribution)
- redis http://redis.io/download

To use admin interface, you'll need to manually add to Redis
- set "admins" of admin names
- for each name, the string with the key "admin.<name>", whose value is a password

So, for example, if you want to use "migmit" as an admin name, with password "secret", you shoud issue the following commands in Redis console:

    SADD "admins" "migmit"
    SET "admin.migmit" "secret"

Admin doesn't have to be a regular user, they are completely independent entities.
